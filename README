Agio SharePoint Migration Assistant
Overview
The Agio SharePoint Migration Assistant is a Python script designed to help identify files with long file paths that may cause issues during a SharePoint migration. It checks for:

Files with paths longer than 256 characters (which SharePoint cannot handle).
Files with paths between 128 and 256 characters, which may still pose challenges.
The results are displayed on the screen and exported to a CSV file for review.

Features
Scans a specified directory for files with long file paths.
Categorizes files into two groups:
Paths longer than 256 characters.
Paths between 128 and 256 characters.
Exports results to a CSV file for easier review.
Logs errors to a file if any issues occur during execution.
Prerequisites
Install Python 3.x if it's not already installed. Download Python
Ensure you have the required permissions to scan the directory.
Installation
Download the find_long_paths.py script and place it in your desired directory.
(Optional) Set up a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the folder containing the find_long_paths.py script.
Run the script using the following command:
bash
Copy code
python find_long_paths.py
Follow the prompts:
Enter the directory path to scan.
Review the results displayed on the screen.
Output
Results will be saved to a CSV file named file_path_report.csv in the same directory as the script.
If errors occur, they will be logged in a file named error_log.txt.

     Checks for file paths longer than 256 characters
  Created by Stephen Corrigan, Agio - November 2024
=============================================

Enter the directory to scan: C:\MyFiles
Scanning for file paths...

Found 2 file(s) with paths longer than 256 characters:
C:\MyFiles\very\long\path\document1.txt
C:\MyFiles\another\very\long\path\document2.txt

These files will not be able to be moved to SharePoint due to long file paths.
The directory structures should be changed or the file paths shortened.

Found 3 file(s) with paths longer than 128 but not exceeding 256 characters:
C:\MyFiles\long\path\document3.txt
C:\MyFiles\longer\path\document4.txt
C:\MyFiles\another\path\document5.txt

These files may cause issues with SharePoint migration and should be reviewed.

Results have been exported to 'file_path_report.csv'.

Press Enter to exit.
CSV File
The exported CSV file, file_path_report.csv, contains the following columns:

File Path: Full path of the file.
Category: Classification based on file path length.
Length: Total number of characters in the file path.
